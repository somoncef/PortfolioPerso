# Launching GlamFlow Skin Analysis API on RapidAPI

After building the [GlamFlow AI web app](https://somoncef.me/blog/GlamFlowAI) — an end-to-end skincare analysis platform powered by **YOLOv8**, **ResNet**, and **large language models** — I realized the real value wasn’t just the application itself, but **making the AI engine accessible to other developers**.

So I packaged GlamFlow into a **production-ready REST API** and launched it on **RapidAPI**, allowing developers to integrate advanced skin analysis with a single HTTP request.

## Why Build a Skin Analysis API?

Beauty brands, telehealth platforms, and e-commerce startups increasingly rely on AI-driven personalization, but most lack in-house machine learning expertise.

By exposing GlamFlow as an API, developers can:

- Integrate **AI skin diagnostics** into mobile and web apps
- Build **personalized skincare product recommenders**
- Create **automated dermatology triage tools**

All without managing ML infrastructure.

## Core Features

- 🧠 **Detection of 15+ skin conditions** (acne, blackheads, wrinkles, dark spots, etc.)
- 💧 **Skin type classification** (dry, normal, oily) with confidence scores
- 💬 **Multilingual AI advice** (English & French) powered by Groq + Llama 3.3
- 📐 **Bounding box coordinates** for UI overlays or AR integrations
- ⚡ **Sub-3 second average latency**, optimized for real-world usage

## API Request Flow

1. Client uploads a face image using `multipart/form-data`
2. Image preprocessing: validation, resizing (max 1024px), and skin presence checks
3. **Parallel AI inference pipeline**:
   - YOLOv8 for skin issue detection and localization
   - ResNet for skin type classification
   - Groq-powered LLM for human-readable skincare recommendations
4. Structured JSON response containing detections, analysis, and routine suggestions

### Example API Request (cURL)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://skin-analysis-api.p.rapidapi.com/predict?lang=en" \
  -H "X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-RapidAPI-Host: skin-analysis-api.p.rapidapi.com" \
  -F "file=@face.jpg"
```

## Example API Response

## Key Technical Challenges

### File Uploads & RapidAPI Threat Protection
Early versions returned 400 errors because RapidAPI's Threat Protection forwarded images as JSON-wrapped base64 in multipart/form-data. Solution: disable threat protection at the gateway and validate uploads at the application layer using RapidAPI proxy headers.

### Performance Optimization
To meet RapidAPI's timeout limits:
- Parallelized YOLOv8 and ResNet inference
- Warmed up models on startup
- Timeout‑protected LLM calls with static fallbacks
- Auto-resized large images (max 1024px)

Result: 95th percentile latency dropped from ~12.4s to ~3.1s.

### Adoption, Pricing & First Paying User
- Monetized via RapidAPI subscription plans (Free, PRO, higher tiers)
- First PRO subscriber acquired organically via the marketplace, validating demand.

### Reliability & Stability
- Continuous health checks and request logging
- Graceful degradation when LLMs fail
- Strict authentication via RapidAPI proxy headers

Operational results for the first month: 99.97% uptime, sub‑3s average latency, zero critical incidents.

### Who Is This API For?
- Beauty & skincare brands
- E‑commerce personalization engines
- Telehealth & dermatology startups
- Mobile app developers
- Agencies delivering AI features

### Key Lessons Learned
- Distribution matters as much as the model
- Developer experience drives adoption
- Performance is critical for ML APIs
- Monetization should be planned from day one
